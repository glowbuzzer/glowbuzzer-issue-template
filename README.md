# Glowbuzzer Issue Template

This project contains a vanilla glowbuzzer React (GBR) app.

## Codesandbox

You can run the app in Codesandbox at the following url:

https://codesandbox.io/s/github/glowbuzzer/glowbuzzer-issue-template

It will be forked automatically and you can then edit as required.

Note that if you want to connect to a locally running instance of the glowbuzzer control (GBC), you
need to enable mixed-mode pages containing HTTPS and non-secure websocket connections to localhost.
To do this in Chrome, click on the padlock icon in the address bar, select Site Settings and find the
option for "Insecure content". Set this to "Allow" temporarily in order to connect to GBC from the app.
